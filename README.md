# odin-landing-page (with a twist)

This is a simple html landing page for the Odin project's coursework--but with a twist!

The assigment is simple: they provide an image of a landing page's layout and information on colors and fonts used for each section. You have to recreate it through code.

However, I thought it would be fun to create a landing page for
my new fire-dancing business, which I call the Flamingos (get it? Flaming... flames?).

Font styles and layout have been preserved. Color scheme altered.
